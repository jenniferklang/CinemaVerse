    We have created Serverside application that uses Node.js with a Rest API. We
    use a relational database (MySQL) and a NoSQL database (MongoDB). We have
    also built a Frontend part for selected parts of the application with VueJs.
    We have planned and implemented in group "Web Server Project" based on a
    MySQL database and MongoDB respectively. This web application is designed so
    that the user can purchase cinema tickets to watch a movie. We have started
    by creating an ER-Diagram and then we have created a database with MySQL.
    Then we create a Rest API plan with "Endpoints" based on the databases. also
    a Frontend part with Vue.js (with Fetch) for selected parts. Collaborators:
    Jennifer Klang, Pontus Abrahamsson, Sheila Martinez, Viktor Mattsson, Roland
    and Daniel W.
